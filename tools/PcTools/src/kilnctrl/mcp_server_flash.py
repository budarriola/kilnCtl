# Firmware flashing (JTAG/OpenOCD only -- CLAUDE.md forbids esptool/idf.py
# flash for this board). Added 2026-08-11 after a debugging session where an
# ad-hoc `flash erase_sector 0 0 last` (meant to clear one region) wiped the
# *entire* chip including the bootloader and partition table, which were then
# only partially reflashed by hand -- the board couldn't boot until a full
# power cycle and a from-scratch 3-image reflash recovered it. This tool
# exists so nobody (agent or human) has to improvise that sequence from
# memory again: it always writes all three images in the one safe order and
# never runs a bare full-chip erase.

    board over JTAG via OpenOCD -- the ONLY sanctioned way to flash this
    board (never esptool/`idf.py flash`, per CLAUDE.md). Always writes all
    three images (bootloader @0x0, partition table @0x8000, app @0x810000),
    each with `program_esp ... verify` (which only erases/rewrites a region
    if its content doesn't already match -- it does NOT do a bare full-chip
    erase), ending in a reset so the board boots the new app immediately.

    Requires `idf.py build` to have already produced KilnFW/build/*.bin --
    this tool does not build, only flashes.

    Before flashing, refuses if KilnCtrl.bin looks stale relative to the
    current source tree (see stale_check.py's module docstring for the full
    mechanism: it compares the git commit recorded in build_info.h at build
    time against current HEAD, and -- if the tree has uncommitted changes in
    firmware/KilnFW or firmware/CommonFW -- whether any of those changed
    files are newer than the binary). This catches flashing a binary built
    before the commit/edit it claims to be. Pass allow_stale=True to flash
    anyway (deliberate reflash-the-existing-image or flash-without-rebuild
    cases) -- the refusal message is still returned as a warning line first.

    A single "Verify Failed" on the very first attempt is a known, benign,
    environment-specific quirk (documented in docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md) that
    reliably succeeds on an immediate identical retry; with retry_once=True
    (the default) this tool does that retry automatically and only reports
    failure if the SECOND attempt also fails. On a persistent failure this
    returns the openocd output tail for diagnosis rather than guessing --
    do not attempt a raw `flash erase_sector` recovery by hand; that is

# check_flash_partition_map.ps1 only validates the REPO's partitions.csv --

# esptool) and diffs them against partitions.csv entry by entry. See
# partition_table.py for the parsing/diff logic (unit-tested against
